## Using mutiple classes: Main class and Person Class

### Declaring classes, creating objects from the classes and interacting between these objects

This application calls th Person class from main class and requests a String variable(name) and integer variable(age) to be passed. Examples of overloaded constructor and an empty constructor are included. * Note: Overloading occurs when two or more methods in one class have the same method name but different parameters. This is different from Overriding a function: which is replacing a function of a method (has two methods with the same method name and parameters).
